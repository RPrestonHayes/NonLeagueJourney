About the Game & Project Goals
"Non-League Journey" aims to provide a unique football management experience by shifting the spotlight from complex tactics to the intricate world of grassroots club administration. Players will navigate financial constraints, facility development, committee politics, and player morale, all while trying to guide their local club up the leagues.
Our Goal: To create a deep, engaging, and highly replayable management simulation that captures the essence of non-league football, with a strong emphasis on off-pitch decisions and community building. An early version of the game will be released for players once all core mechanics are fully functional.

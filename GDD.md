Game Design Document: Non-League Journey
1. Game Overview
Game Title (Working Title): Non-League Journey (or "Sileby FC: Grassroots Glory," "The Gaffer's Gauntlet," "Bottom of the Pyramid")

Genre: Football Management Simulation, Sports Simulation, Resource Management, Narrative-Driven.

Platform: HTML5 (Browser-based, client-side, mobile-first design)

Core Concept: Players take on the role of the owner/chairperson of a hyper-local non-league football club, starting at the very bottom of the pyramid. The primary focus is on comprehensive off-pitch club management, community engagement, and building a sustainable club from humble beginnings, with on-pitch results providing narrative progression.

2. Player Experience & Starting Scenario
Players choose a background that influences their initial resources, relationships, and challenges.

2.1 Player Backgrounds
Hometown Hero (Player-Manager):

Premise: A local who played for the club for years, now stepping up to run it, potentially still playing.

Starting State: Limited personal funds, strong initial relationships and loyalty from existing (unpaid) players and local community. Committee is informal and trusting.

Core Challenge: Overcoming financial constraints, balancing playing and managerial duties, persuading a traditional committee to embrace change.

Gameplay Focus: Player morale, tactical understanding, committee persuasion, leading by example on the pitch.

Local Businessman (Owner/Investor):

Premise: A local entrepreneur with financial backing, looking to inject money and business acumen into the club.

Starting State: Significant starting capital, weaker initial relationships with existing club members (potential for skepticism/resentment). Committee may be resistant to purely commercial ideas.

Core Challenge: Earning the trust of the community and club stalwarts, making financially sound investments, proving commitment beyond money.

Gameplay Focus: Financial management, facility investment, sponsorship deals, PR management, strategic staff hires.

Former Manager (Owner/Manager):

Premise: An experienced, perhaps recently out-of-work, manager who takes over a struggling grassroots club, using their knowledge to build it up.

Starting State: Moderate personal funds, strong tactical and player management knowledge. No pre-existing deep ties to this specific club's community. Committee may defer to expertise but demand quick results.

Core Challenge: Applying high-level football knowledge to a grassroots environment, building a new reputation, attracting players without initial strong financial incentives.

Gameplay Focus: Player recruitment, tactical development, staff acquisition, efficient resource allocation.

2.2 Starting Club Status (Common to all backgrounds)
Facilities: A basic field with a pitch (often muddy), a small, dilapidated hut for changing rooms. No toilets, no food amenities, no ticketing infrastructure.

Players: All part-time and unpaid volunteers (friends, work colleagues, locals). Player "commitment" is a key stat.

Committee: Small, informal, volunteer-run (Chairperson, Secretary, Treasurer, Groundsman â€“ some roles might be combined or informal).

Finances: Extremely limited, relying on player subscriptions and ad-hoc small donations.

League: The "Sileby & Wreake Valley League Division Three" (or similar hyper-local, unofficial league), just above Sunday League quality. Opponent teams are local village sides, reserve teams, or works teams. Promotion from this league is a significant step into the official National League System (e.g., Step 7 or 8).

2.3 Customisation Options
Hometown Selection (Must choose, no default): At the very start of a new game, the player must choose their club's hometown. This choice will influence the generation of local rivals and the initial league name.

Your Club Customisation:

Initial Setup (One-time Free Edit): At the start of a new game, the player can freely change their generated club's name, nickname/mascot, primary kit colors, and secondary kit colors.

Subsequent Changes (Committee Approval Required): Any further changes to the player's club name, nickname, or colors after the initial setup will require presenting a proposal to the committee. This will be subject to their approval, influenced by their personalities, the club's current status, and potentially incur a small cost or hit to committee relations.

Opposition Team Customisation:

League Start (One-time Edit): At the very beginning of the first season (after league generation but before the first match), the player will have a one-time opportunity to edit the names, primary kit colors, and secondary kit colors of the opponent teams in their starting league.

Permanence: Once these changes are saved, they are permanent for those specific clubs throughout the game's history. Players cannot re-edit opponent club details in subsequent seasons or once the initial customization phase is passed. This ensures consistency and reflects the player's limited control over rival clubs.

3. Core Gameplay Loop
The game operates on a seasonal cycle, broken down into weekly/daily actions, committee meetings, and match days.

3.1 Club Management (Primary Focus)
This is the heart of the game, focusing on interactions, resource management, and strategic decisions.

Time Management / Weekly Schedule (CENTRAL MECHANIC):

Concept: The player has a limited number of "hours" or "action points" available each day/week to dedicate to club tasks.

Task Allocation: Players must strategically choose which tasks to prioritize (e.g., Pitch Maintenance, Recruiting Players, Fundraising Event Planning, Player Conversations, Committee Member Engagement). Each task consumes a set amount of time.

Volunteer/Staff Impact:

Volunteers: Reduce the time you need to spend on tasks they assist with, or improve the efficiency/quality of the task. For example, a dedicated Kit Washer means you don't spend time on laundry. A Groundsman volunteer reduces your Pitch Maintenance time.

Paid Staff (Later Game): Can fully automate certain tasks, or perform them with much higher efficiency and quality, freeing up your time for strategic decisions.

Committee Management:

Mechanic: Regular (e.g., monthly) committee meetings. Present proposals (e.g., fundraising event, facility upgrade, club identity change), manage discussions, gain consensus through persuasion (influenced by your relationship, club success, and their individual traits like "resistance to change").

Members: Each member has unique skills (e.g., Administration, Financial Acumen, Grounds Keeping), personality traits (e.g., Loyalty, Enthusiasm, Influence), and relationships with you.

Outcomes: Successful proposals unlock new actions, funds, or improvements. Failed proposals can lead to committee member dissatisfaction or even departure.

Player Relationship Management (Unpaid Focus):

Recruitment: "Word-of-mouth" scouting (ask existing players, committee, locals), attending local pub league matches (abstracted). Convincing players to join (and stay!) based on your vision, club atmosphere, and potential.

Individual Conversations: Dialogue options to motivate players, discuss their commitment (crucial for unpaid players), address concerns, build loyalty. This consumes player's weekly "time."

Morale & Commitment: Directly impacted by wins/losses, individual performance, your interactions, facility quality, and club atmosphere. Low commitment means players miss training/matches.

Volunteer & Staffing:

Volunteers: Attract volunteers for essential tasks (kit washing, line marking, tea-hut duties, matchday stewarding) through club success, community outreach events, and good reputation. Manage their engagement and reliability. Their presence directly impacts the Time Management system.

Paid Staff (Later Game): As finances improve (later game), transition key roles (Groundsman, Secretary, Physio, Coach) from volunteer to paid positions to increase efficiency and quality. This is a significant progression milestone, further impacting Time Management.

Finances & Fundraising:

Income: Player subscriptions, small local sponsorships (pub, chippy, local garage), ad-hoc donations, small fundraising events (pub quizzes, car washes, bake sales, raffles). These often require player's "time" to organize and execute.

Expenses: Pitch hire fees (if not owned), kit, basic equipment, minimal travel, utility bills for the changing hut.

Loans/Debt: Potential for taking small local loans from benefactors in emergencies (with risks).

Budgeting: Allocate limited funds between immediate needs (kit), small improvements, and essential upkeep.

Facilities & Groundwork:

Initial: Manual line marking, basic grass cutting, cleaning the hut. These tasks consume player's time if no volunteers are available.

Upgrades: Invest in improving existing facilities (e.g., better changing rooms, basic toilets, secure fencing, a small, covered standing area). All upgrades require funds, potentially planning permission, and committee approval.

Ground Grading: As you climb divisions, facilities will need to meet minimum league requirements (Ground Grading). Failure to do so blocks promotion.

Local Community & Council Relations:

Council: Apply for planning permission for major upgrades, potentially seek small community grants. Manage any local grievances (e.g., noise complaints, parking). These interactions can consume player's time.

Residents: Engage through community events (open training, youth clinics), maintain a positive club image. Positive relations can unlock new volunteers or local support.

3.2 The Football Side (Secondary Focus, initially simplified)
League Structure: A single hyper-local league in Season 1. Progression leads to official National League System steps.

Fixed Weekly/Monthly Events (Integrates with Time Management):

Matches: A major weekly event during the season. It consumes a significant portion of your weekly "time" (e.g., pre-match preparation, match attendance, post-match clean-up and analysis).

Committee Meetings: Monthly fixed events that also consume a set amount of your time.

Match Simulation:

Pre-Match: Select starting XI (from available, committed players), set basic tactical approach (e.g., Attacking, Balanced, Defensive), deliver a simple team talk (morale impact).

Simulation Factors: Player attributes, morale, fitness, manager tactical skill, pitch conditions, weather, referee personality, and a "rub of the green" random factor.

Outcome: A match report with scoreline, goalscorers, key incidents (injuries, cards), and a brief text commentary.

Post-Match Impact: Updates to league table, player morale shifts, potential injuries/suspensions.

Random Events System:

Frequency: Occurs randomly week-to-week, before the match day.

Nature: Can be positive, negative, or neutral. Adds unpredictability and forces reactive management.

Examples:

Negative: Dogs running on the pitch causing damage (requires Pitch Maintenance time/cost), equipment breakdown (e.g., lawnmower, kit dryer), a key player calling in sick at the last minute for a match due to work, vandalism to the changing hut, a council complaint about noise.

Positive: A new, reliable volunteer appears, a small local business offers a minor sponsorship, a youth player from the village expresses interest in joining, finding a piece of old, usable equipment.

Neutral: Unexpected good weather, a local journalist wanting an interview (opportunity for PR or risk of misquotes).

Player Response: Requires player action and resource allocation (time, money, committee persuasion) to resolve negative events or capitalize on positive ones.

Promotion/Relegation: Clear progression path (or or struggle) through league standings. Ground Grading requirements are crucial for promotion.

4. Game World & Setting
Hometown: Chosen by the player at game start.

Local Leagues: Procedurally generated local and regional leagues, initially focused on the immediate area around the chosen hometown.

Opponent Clubs:

Generation: Names (e.g., "Mountsorrel Amateurs," "Barrow Town Corinthians," "Melton Town Reserves"), simple location, and an Overall_Team_Quality rating.

5. Data & Systems
The game relies heavily on numerical attributes and clear data presentation.

5.1 Personal Profiles & Skills
Players: Detailed Core Info, Physical, Technical, Mental Attributes (1-20 scale), Personality/Social Traits, Current Season Stats, Current Status (Morale, Fitness, Injury).

Committee Members: Core Info, Skills/Attributes (1-10/1-20 scale), Personality/Relationships, Current Satisfaction.

Volunteers: Core Info, Role, Skills/Attributes, Engagement status.

5.2 Financial System
Detailed tracking of Income (subscriptions, fundraising, sponsorship) and Expenses (pitch fees, kit, maintenance).

Current Balance updated in real-time.

5.3 Match Simulation Factors
Player attributes, morale, fitness.

Manager tactical choices.

Pitch conditions, weather.

Referee bias.

Random "luck" factor.

5.4 Data Persistence Strategy (Updated for Compression)
Overall Save Mechanism: The entire game state will be collected into a single JavaScript object, converted to a JSON string, then compressed using a dedicated JavaScript compression library (e.g., LZ-String) before being saved to localStorage. On load, the process is reversed.

"Shortcodes" for Data Minimization:

Enums/Constants: Verbose strings (e.g., player positions, personality types, event types) will be mapped to shorter numerical or string codes for storage (defined in a constants.js module). These will be expanded to full text only for UI display.

Reference IDs: Complex objects will primarily be stored once (e.g., playerData.js will hold all detailed player profiles). Other parts of the game state will refer to these objects via their unique IDs, preventing data duplication.

Match Reports & Event Logs: For historical data, these will store only essential, calculated data points (scores, goal/card/injury IDs, basic outcomes). Full descriptive text will be dynamically generated upon viewing, rather than stored for every single record.

Your Club's Data (Persistent): All data related to the player's club (finances, facilities, committee, players, volunteers, full club history, match reports) is stored indefinitely. This includes the player's chosen hometown, club name, nickname, and kit colors.

Opponent Club Structural Data (Persistent): Club_ID, Club_Name, Location, Current_League_ID, Final_League_Position (from previous season), Overall_Team_Quality, and customised kit colors/nicknames are persistent for all clubs in the game world to maintain league structure and progression over multiple seasons.

Opponent Club Dynamic Data (Season-Only): For opponent clubs, player lists and all individual player stats (goals, assists, cards) are generated at the start of each season and discarded at the end of it to optimize memory usage. Their current season league position (during the season) and current season match results are also only stored for the active season.

End-of-Season Export: All relevant data for the completed season (e.g., final league table with all teams, top scorers list including AI players) is compiled and made available for CSV export before being cleared from active memory for non-player club dynamic data.

6. User Interface (High-Level)
Navigation: Clear, intuitive menu system (e.g., Home, Squad, Facilities, Finances, League, Fixtures, Committee, History). Designed for mobile-first.

Data Presentation: Extensive use of tables, lists, and simple bar graphs for financial trends, player attribute comparisons, etc.

Interactions: Clearly visible buttons for actions, dialogue choices for conversations.

Visuals: Clean, functional design. Emphasis on readability over flashy graphics.

7. Technical Considerations (HTML/JS)
HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript: Entirely client-side.

No Backend: All game logic and data storage handled in the browser (localStorage).

Dynamic Content: JavaScript used to render UI, manage game state, and simulate events.

CSV Generation & Download: JavaScript functions to convert in-game data arrays into CSV strings and trigger file downloads via Blob and <a> elements.

Responsive Design: Utilise custom CSS for layouts that adapt well to mobile and larger screens, ensuring consistent and easy-to-follow design.

Save File Optimization: Integration of a JavaScript compression library (e.g., LZ-String) with a "shortcode" serialization strategy to drastically reduce localStorage footprint.

8. Non-Negotiable Must-Haves
These are the critical features that define the game and must be present from early development.

Detailed Player Profiles: All Core Info, Physical, Technical, Mental Attributes (1-20 scale), Personality/Social Traits, Current Season Stats, Current Status (Morale, Fitness, Injury).

Committee/Staff Profiles: Core Info, Skills/Attributes, Personality/Relationships, Current Satisfaction.

Hyper-Local First Season: Starting in a truly grassroots league (e.g., "Sileby & Wreake Valley League Division Three") with basic facilities and unpaid players.

Emphasis on Off-Pitch Management: Core gameplay revolves around committee meetings, volunteer management, fundraising, facility upgrades, and local relations.

Simplified Match Simulation: Matches are abstracted to brief text reports and statistical outcomes, rather than detailed tactical play.

Comprehensive CSV Export:

Ability to export all major data sets: League Tables (current & historical), Your Club's Squad (full profiles & stats), Club Finances (transactions & summaries), Facilities Data, Match History (all your club's matches), and full Club History (seasonal summaries).

Data for your club is fully persistent and exportable.

Structural data for opponent clubs (name, location, current league, final league position) is persistent to maintain pyramid integrity.

Dynamic data for opponent clubs (individual player stats, detailed match results) is season-only and available for export only at the end of the season.

Weekly Time Management System: Player has limited "hours" or "action points" per day/week to allocate to tasks. Volunteers/staff reduce time consumption or automate tasks.

Random Event System: Weekly (pre-match) occurrences (good/bad/neutral) that require player response and resource allocation.

Club & Opponent Customisation:

Your club: Player must choose hometown; one-time free edit of club name/colors at start, subsequent changes require committee approval.

Opponent clubs: One-time edit of names/colors at the very start of Season 1 (after generation), then permanent.

Efficient Save File Management: Implementation of "shortcodes" for data minimization and an external compression library (e.g., LZ-String) for drastic reduction of localStorage footprint.
